# DLT_Log_Analyzer

This is a simple Diagnostic Log Tool (DLT) implemented as a bash shell script. It's designed to analyze log files generated by a Linux machine, providing a practical exercise for understanding basic Linux administration and log analysis concepts.

## Features:

- **Log Summarization:** Generates summaries of log entries based on:
    - Severity levels (Errors, Warnings, Info, Debug)
    - Specific event patterns (e.g., Startup Events, System Health)
- **Filtered Log Views:** Allows users to view log entries filtered by:
    - Specific severity levels
    - Specific event patterns
- **Full Log Access:** Provides an option to view the complete log content.

## Usage:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - A Linux machine (virtual machine recommended for practice)
   - A log file to analyze (e.g., `/var/log/syslog`)

2. **Copy the Script:**
   Copy the `dlt.sh` script to your Linux machine.

3. **Make the Script Executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x dlt.sh

4. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   ./dlt.sh

## Example:
    Select log categories to generate:
    1. Errors
    2. Warnings
    3. Info
    4. Debug
    5. All
    6. Summarize
    7. Startup Events
    8. System Health
    9. Quit
    Enter your choice (1-9): 1

    ---- ERROR Events ----
    [timestamp] [process] ERROR: This is an error message.
    [timestamp] [process] ERROR: Another error occurred.
    Total ERROR events: 2

    Categorization complete.


## Note:
This DLT is a basic implementation for educational purposes. It can be further enhanced with features like real-time log monitoring, log rotation, remote log access, and a graphical user interface.
